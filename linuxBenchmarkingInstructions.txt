Copy the File: Move the benchmarking-linux file to your Bazzite OS machine (e.g., into your Home or Downloads folder).

Make it Executable: By default, for security reasons, Linux doesn't treat new files as programs you can run. You need to give it "executable" permission first.

Open a terminal on Bazzite OS.
Navigate to the folder where you saved the file. For example: cd ~/Downloads
Run the chmod (change mode) command:
Bash

chmod +x benchmarking-linux
This command means "change mode" and "+x" means "add executable permission." You only need to do this once.
Run the Executable: Now you can run your benchmark directly from the terminal.

Bash

./benchmarking-linux
(The ./ at the beginning is importantâ€”it tells the terminal to look for the program in the current directory).
